#DBD7CACC       Today I am learning \LaTeX. %notice how the command will end at the first non-alphabet charecter such as the . after \LaTeX
#DBD7CACC           \LaTeX{} is a great program for writing math. I can write in line math such as 
#C98A7D77      $
#B8A965        a^2+b^2=c^2
#C98A7D77      $
#DBD7CACC       %
#C98A7D77      $
#B8A965         tells LaTexX to compile as math
#B8A965             . I can also give equations their own space:
#B8A965            
#444444        \
#B8A965        begin
#444444        {
#DBD7CACC      equation
#444444        }
#B8A965         % Creates an equation environment and is compiled as math
#B8A965            \gamma^2+\theta^2=\omega^2
#B8A965            
#444444        \
#B8A965        end
#444444        {
#DBD7CACC      equation
#444444        }
#B8A965            If I do not leave any blank lines \LaTeX{} will continue  this text without making it into a new paragraph.  Notice how there was no indentation in the text after equation (1).
#B8A965            Also notice how even though I hit enter after that sentence and here 
#C98A7D77      $
#DBD7CACC      \downarrow
#C98A7D77      $
#B8A965             \LaTeX{} formats the sentence without any break.  Also   look  how      it   doesn't     matter          how    many  spaces     I put     between       my    words.
#B8A965            For a new paragraph I can leave a blank space in my code.
